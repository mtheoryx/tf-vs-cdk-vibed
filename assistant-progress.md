# Assistant Progress Tracker ü§ñ

*Your friendly AI companion's notes and progress on the tf-vs-cdk comparison project*

---

## Project Understanding

This is **NOT** just a simple tf-vs-cdk comparison - this is a comprehensive, multi-phase infrastructure experiment! You're building a complete content management system and testing it across different deployment paradigms:

**The Real Scope:**
- **Phase 1:** Traditional n-tier architecture (VPC + EC2 + Aurora PostgreSQL)
- **Phase 2:** Managed services migration (Lightsail/Beanstalk) 
- **Phase 3:** High availability & resilience testing (multi-AZ, failover scenarios)
- **Phase 4:** Modern serverless/static site architecture
- **Throughout:** Cost analysis, developer ergonomics, and platform portability

**The Bigger Picture:**
This is about proving that developers can own their content, understand their costs, and maintain platform independence - while comparing Terraform vs CDK as the IaC tools to get there.

**Project Structure:**
- `tf/` - Terraform implementations for all phases
- `cdk/` - AWS CDK implementations for all phases  
- `presentation/` - Materials for talks/demos
- `engineer-notes.md` - Your strategic vision and requirements
- `assistant-progress.md` - This file (my tracking companion!)

## Current Status Observations

**Project State:** Early stage - directory structure exists but no implementation yet
- ‚úÖ Project directories created (`tf/`, `cdk/`, `presentation/`)
- ‚úÖ Basic documentation files in place (`README.md`, `engineer-notes.md`)
- ‚è≥ No actual infrastructure code implemented yet
- ‚è≥ No specific infrastructure requirements defined

**Next Steps Needed:**
- Define what infrastructure we want to build with both tools
- Set up initial Terraform configuration
- Set up initial CDK configuration
- Create comparison documentation

- [ ] **Choose CMS Platform** - Find alternatives to WordPress (as requested)
- [ ] **Configure Aurora PostgreSQL** - Private subnet database tier
- [ ] **Implement in Terraform** - Complete Phase 1 infrastructure
- [ ] **Implement in CDK** - Same infrastructure, different tool
- [ ] **Cost Analysis** - Track all resource costs from day 1

## Notes & Insights

### This Changes Everything! 
- This isn't just a tool comparison - it's a **comprehensive infrastructure evolution experiment**
- The cost-conscious approach is brilliant - tracking costs from day 1 will provide real insights
- The progression from traditional ‚Üí managed ‚Üí serverless mirrors real-world adoption patterns
- The focus on **platform portability** addresses a critical gap in most cloud discussions

### Key Considerations I'll Focus On
- **Cost transparency** - Every resource needs cost tracking and cleanup procedures
- **CMS alternatives to WordPress** - Need to research modern, portable CMS options
- **Resilience testing** - Actual failure scenarios, not just theoretical HA
- **Developer ergonomics** - Measuring the human experience across different approaches
- **Platform independence** - Ensuring content can move between providers

### Questions to Explore
- What CMS alternatives to WordPress should we consider? (Strapi, Ghost, Sanity, etc.) ‚úÖ **RESEARCHED**
- How do we measure "developer ergonomics" quantitatively?
- What specific failure scenarios should we test for resilience?
- How do we ensure true platform portability (not just AWS-to-AWS)?

### CMS Landscape Research Results üéØ
**Current Market Status (2024):**
- WordPress: Still dominates at 43.3% of all websites, 60.7% of CMS-powered sites
- Joomla: Declined to ~2.0% market share (was much higher historically)
- Drupal: Declined to ~1.1% market share (enterprise still uses it heavily)
- Modern trend: SaaS platforms (Shopify, Wix, Squarespace) growing rapidly
- Headless CMS: Emerging as developer-preferred option

**Top N-Tier Architecture Candidates:**
1. **Ghost** - Modern, Node.js-based, PostgreSQL-ready, excellent for blogs ‚úÖ **CONTENT OWNERSHIP ANALYZED**
2. **Strapi** - Headless, Node.js, PostgreSQL/MySQL, highly customizable
3. **October CMS** - Laravel-based, PostgreSQL support, simpler than WordPress
4. **Drupal 10** - Still enterprise-grade, PostgreSQL support, complex but powerful
5. **Enonic XP** - Java-based, Elasticsearch (no SQL!), fully decoupled
6. **Umbraco** - .NET-based, SQL Server, good for Microsoft shops

### Ghost Content Ownership Analysis üîç
**The Good News:**
- ‚úÖ **Self-hosted option** - You can run it on your own infrastructure
- ‚úÖ **Open source** - Full access to source code and database schema
- ‚úÖ **PostgreSQL support** - Fits your N-tier architecture perfectly
- ‚úÖ **JSON export/import** - Built-in content portability tools
- ‚úÖ **Database access** - Direct PostgreSQL access to all content

**The Reality Check:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Ghost Pro vs Self-hosted** - Most people use Ghost Pro (hosted), not self-hosted
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Export format limitations** - JSON export may not include all metadata/customizations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Theme dependencies** - Content formatting tied to Ghost's theme system
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **API limitations** - Some content may require Ghost-specific API calls

**True Ownership Test:**
- Can you migrate to another platform in 1 week? **YES** (with caveats)
- Can you access raw content data? **YES** (PostgreSQL direct access)
- Can you modify the platform? **YES** (open source)
- Are you vendor-locked? **NO** (but migration effort required)

### Ghost Content Seeding Research üéØ
**Your Current Setup:** Gatsby site with Markdown articles ‚Üí AWS Amplify
**Goal:** Seed Ghost with test content for N-tier experiment

**Seeding Options Available:**
1. **JSON Import** - Ghost's built-in import functionality
2. **Admin API** - Programmatic content creation
3. **Database Direct** - PostgreSQL inserts (advanced)
4. **Community Demo Content** - Pre-made test content

**Recommended Approach:** JSON Import + Admin API hybrid
- Use JSON for bulk content structure
- Use Admin API for dynamic content generation
- Perfect for testing your N-tier architecture

### Faker.js Content Seeder Created! üéØ
**Files Created:**
- `ghost-content-seeder.js` - Main seeding script
- `package.json` - Dependencies and npm scripts
- `ghost-seeder-README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

**What It Generates:**

- **25 Tags** - Diverse categories (commerce, science, animals, music, etc.)
- **100 Posts** - Rich content with multiple tags, various authors, SEO metadata
- **10 Pages** - Static pages for testing different content types

**Key Features:**

docker-compose up -d

# Access Ghost
open http://localhost/ghost

# Seed with test content
export GHOST_ADMIN_API_KEY="your-key"
docker-compose --profile seeder run --rm seeder
```
